            <b> Calculus</b>a branch of Mathematics , developed by <b> <i>Newton and Leibniz </i></b>, deals with the study of the rate of change clculas define formula like f(2)<sup> n </sup> <abb Centi Meter > CM </abb> is generally used in Mathematical models to obtain optimal solution. <i> It helps us to understand the change between the value which are related by a function </i> . Calculus Math mainly focused on some important topics such as <b> differenttiation , integration , limits , functions , </b> and so on . Scientific calilations provide formilas like H<sub> 2 </sub> SO <sub> 4 </sub>
